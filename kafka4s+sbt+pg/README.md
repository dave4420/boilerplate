# kafka4s+sbt+pg boilerplate

Boilerplate for a Kafka consumer, using Scala and kafka4s, with a
dedicated Postgres database.

Still WIP!

Also, using Scala 2.13 because I’ve not used Scala 3.x yet… I might
upgrade it to 3.2 later on.

## Prerequisites

- a JVM installed and on the PATH
- sbt installed

## Commands

- `sbt compile` — build code
- `sbt test` — build and run tests
- `sbt assembly` — build fat jar

## TODO

- everything
- build docker image for deployment

## Out of scope

- DAVE
